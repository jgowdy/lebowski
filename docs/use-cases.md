# Lebowski Use Cases

## Example User Scenarios

### 1. Performance Enthusiast

**User**: Sarah runs a high-performance computing cluster with AMD EPYC processors.

**Problem**: Official Debian packages are built with generic x86_64 optimizations for broad compatibility.

**Lebowski Solution**: Sarah installs CPU-intensive packages (gcc, python3, ffmpeg) built with `-march=znver3` optimizations specific to her EPYC processors.

**Benefit**: 10-30% performance improvement in compute-intensive workloads.

### 2. Privacy-Conscious User

**User**: Alex wants Firefox without telemetry.

**Problem**: Official Debian Firefox includes telemetry features enabled by default.

**Lebowski Solution**: Alex installs a Firefox variant built with all telemetry features disabled at compile time.

**Benefit**: Guaranteed no telemetry, not just disabled by config.

---

### 3. Feature Flag Experimenter

**User**: Maria wants to try experimental features in stable software.

**Problem**: Debian stable packages have conservative feature sets.

**Lebowski Solution**: Maria installs nginx built with experimental QUIC/HTTP3 support.

**Benefit**: Try cutting-edge features while staying on Debian stable.

---

### 4. Minimal System Builder

**User**: Tom is building minimal containers.

**Problem**: Official packages include features he doesn't need, increasing attack surface.

**Lebowski Solution**: Tom uses variants of common packages built with minimal feature sets (e.g., curl without LDAP, SMTP support).

**Benefit**: Smaller images, reduced attack surface.

---

### 5. Security Hardening

**User**: Enterprise sysadmin wants hardened packages.

**Problem**: Official packages don't use all available hardening flags.

**Lebowski Solution**: Install packages built with additional hardening flags (`-fstack-protector-strong`, `_FORTIFY_SOURCE=3`, etc.)

**Benefit**: Enhanced security posture.

---

### 6. Backport Seeker

**User**: Developer needs a bug fix from upstream that isn't in Debian stable.

**Problem**: Waiting for next Debian release or manual backporting.

**Lebowski Solution**: Install package variant with specific upstream patch backported.

**Benefit**: Get fixes immediately without upgrading entire system.
