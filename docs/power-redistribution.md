# Re-Empowering the Common User

## The New Elite

### How We Got Here

**1980s-1990s: The Original Revolution**

```
Enemy: Proprietary software vendors
  - Microsoft, Oracle, Sun, etc.
  - Control through licenses
  - Control through closed source
  - Users powerless

Solution: Free Software
  - GPL
  - Open source
  - User freedom
  - Power to the people
```

**The Promise:** Take power from corporations, give it to users.

**What Actually Happened:** We took power from corporations and gave it to... a different elite.

### The New Gatekeepers

**Who are they?**

- Debian Developers (DD)
- Kernel maintainers
- systemd developers
- glibc maintainers
- Core infrastructure maintainers

**What power do they hold?**

- Decide what gets packaged
- Decide how it's built
- Decide what features are enabled
- Decide what's "good for users"
- Decide what's "best practices"
- Control the ecosystem

**Sound familiar?**

It should. It's the same power structure, just different people.

### The Irony

**They say:**
- "We defend user freedom"
- "We know what's best"
- "Trust us, we're experts"
- "This is for your own good"
- "You don't understand the complexity"

**Microsoft said:**
- "We know what's best for users"
- "Trust us, we're experts"
- "This is for your own good"
- "You don't understand the complexity"

**Different actors. Same power structure. Same rhetoric.**

## The Systemd Example

### The Pattern

**Before systemd:**
- Multiple init systems
- User choice
- Competition
- Diversity

**After systemd:**
- One init system dominates
- "You can choose, but good luck"
- Everything depends on it
- Forced adoption

**How it happened:**
- Systemd developers: "This is better"
- Debian (and others): "We agree"
- Dependencies: "Everything requires systemd now"
- Users: "I have no choice"

**Where was user choice?**

Nowhere. The gatekeepers decided. Users lost.

### The Response to Criticism

**Users:** "We don't want systemd"

**Gatekeepers:**
- "You don't understand"
- "It's technically superior"
- "You're just resistant to change"
- "Fork the distro if you don't like it"

**Translation:** "Shut up and accept our decision."

### The Fork Tax

"Just fork it" they say.

**The reality of forking:**
- Maintain entire distribution
- Keep up with security updates
- Track thousands of packages
- Build infrastructure
- Coordinate contributors
- Essentially: recreate Debian

**This is not a realistic option. They know it. That's why they say it.**

It's the same as Microsoft saying "just write your own OS if you don't like Windows."

**The fork tax is designed to prevent user choice.**

## The Kernel Example

### Build Your Own Kernel

**User:** "I want different kernel config"

**Kernel maintainers / Distro maintainers:** "Just build your own kernel"

**What that actually means:**
```bash
# Download kernel source
# Configure 10,000+ options
# Wait hours for compilation
# Install new kernel
# Deal with bootloader
# Deal with modules
# Deal with updates (repeat above every security update)
# Deal with headers
# Deal with dkms
```

**This is designed to be painful.**

If they wanted users to customize kernels, they'd make it easy. They don't. They make it hard.

**Why?** Because easy customization means loss of control.

## The Debian Developer Example

### The Official Path

**Want to change how a package is built in Debian?**

1. Become a Debian Maintainer (DM)
   - Contribute for years
   - Get sponsored
   - Prove yourself

2. Become a Debian Developer (DD)
   - More contributions
   - More proving yourself
   - Get voted in

3. Propose change
   - Technical committee
   - Mailing list debates
   - Politics
   - Waiting

4. Maybe, eventually, your change is accepted
   - If you're persistent
   - If you convince the gatekeepers
   - If you have the "right" opinion

**Time required:** Years

**Gatekeepers to convince:** Many

**Likelihood of success if your opinion differs from theirs:** Low

### The Unofficial Path

**Or just use their packages and shut up.**

That's what they prefer.

## The glibc Example

### The GNU C Library

**Everyone uses it. Almost impossible to replace.**

**Try using an alternative:**
- musl libc (incompatibilities)
- Different allocator (malloc)
- Custom build flags

**What happens:**
- Things break
- No support
- "You're on your own"
- "That's not supported"

**Why?** Because glibc maintainers decided what's "correct" and built the ecosystem to depend on their decisions.

**Your choice:** Use our glibc our way, or suffer.

## The Power Dynamic

### Traditional Power (Corporations)

```
Microsoft/Oracle/etc
        ↓
   (closed source)
        ↓
      Users
   (no power)
```

**Control mechanism:** Closed source, licenses, legal threats

### Current Power (Open Source Elite)

```
DD/Kernel Maintainers/etc
        ↓
  (gatekeeping)
        ↓
      Users
   (no power)
```

**Control mechanism:** Complexity, forking cost, social pressure

### The Rhetoric vs Reality

**They claim:**
- "It's open source, you can change it"
- "Fork it if you don't like it"
- "Submit a patch"
- "User freedom"

**Reality:**
- Changes blocked by gatekeepers
- Forking is prohibitively expensive
- Patches rejected if wrong "opinion"
- Freedom for maintainers, not users

## The Lebowski Revolution

### The Problem Statement

**Current state:**
- Gatekeepers control package builds
- Users accept what they're given
- Choice is theoretical, not practical
- "Expert" opinions override user needs

**This is unacceptable.**

### The Solution

**Re-empower common users at the expense of the gatekeepers.**

Not asking permission.
Not waiting for approval.
Not convincing gatekeepers.

**Just doing it.**

### How Lebowski Transfers Power

#### 1. From Gatekeeper Decisions to User Choice

**Before (Debian's way):**
```
Debian DD: "Python should be built this way"
      ↓
User: "Okay, I'll use that"
```

**After (Lebowski's way):**
```
User: "I want Python with PGO optimization"
      ↓
Lebowski: "Here you go"

No asking permission.
No convincing gatekeepers.
No waiting years.
```

#### 2. From Centralized Control to Distributed Opinions

**Before:**
- One official Debian opinion
- "Our way or fork"

**After:**
- Many opinions
- Take your pick
- Create your own
- No gatekeepers required

#### 3. From Expert Decree to User Sovereignty

**Before:**
- "We know what's best for you"
- "Trust our expertise"
- "You don't understand the complexity"

**After:**
- "You know what's best for you"
- "Verify, don't trust"
- "It's your computer, your choice"

#### 4. From Fork Tax to Easy Customization

**Before:**
- Want different build flags? Fork the entire distro
- Want custom kernel? Become a kernel developer
- Want custom package? Become a DD

**After:**
- Want different build flags? Write a 10-line YAML file
- Want custom kernel? Same
- Want custom package? Same

**No fork tax. No gatekeeper approval. Just do it.**

### The Political Statement

**Lebowski explicitly takes power from:**
- Debian Developers
- Package maintainers
- Distribution gatekeepers
- "Experts" who "know better"

**And gives it to:**
- Common users
- Individual choice
- Community consensus
- Actual freedom

**This is not a bug. This is the feature.**

## The Objections

### "But Users Don't Know What's Best"

**This is exactly what Microsoft said.**

"Users don't know what's best, so we'll decide for them."

**Our response:**

Users are smart enough to:
- Choose their own software
- Read opinion definitions
- Verify builds
- Make decisions

If they're not, they can use the defaults. But choice should exist.

### "But This Will Fragment the Ecosystem"

**This is exactly what proprietary vendors said about open source.**

"Fragmentation is bad. Everyone should use our standard."

**Our response:**

Diversity is not fragmentation. It's strength.

One-size-fits-all is not unity. It's tyranny.

### "But We Have Expertise"

**We don't dispute your expertise.**

We dispute your authority to impose your opinions on everyone.

Expert: "I think this is the best way"
Lebowski: "Great, that's one opinion. Here are others."

Expert opinion should inform choice, not dictate it.

### "But Build Flags Are Dangerous"

**Then publish the dangers and let users decide.**

- Opinion says: "This disables thread safety for 20% speedup"
- User reads it
- User decides

Treating users like children who need protection is paternalism.

We reject paternalism.

### "But Support Will Be Nightmare"

**Then don't support it.**

User chose different build flags? They accept the consequences.

Opinion is clearly marked with purity level and risks.

User made informed choice.

This is freedom.

## The Historical Parallel

### 1970s-1980s: Mainframe Era

**Power structure:**
- IBM and others controlled computing
- Users used what they were given
- Experts knew best
- Centralized control

**Revolution:**
- Personal computers
- User choice
- Democratization of computing

### 1990s-2000s: Proprietary Software Era

**Power structure:**
- Microsoft, Oracle, etc. controlled software
- Users used what they were given
- Vendors knew best
- Licenses controlled usage

**Revolution:**
- Free/Open Source Software
- User freedom
- GPL
- Democratization of software

### 2020s: Open Source Elite Era

**Power structure:**
- DD, kernel maintainers, systemd devs control decisions
- Users use what they're given
- Maintainers know best
- Complexity controls access

**Revolution:**
- Lebowski
- User choice
- Reproducible opinions
- Democratization of build decisions

**Same pattern. New revolution.**

## The Vision

### Short Term (1-2 years)

**Users can:**
- Build any Debian package with custom flags
- One command, no expertise required
- No asking permission
- No waiting for approval

**Impact:**
- Gatekeepers lose control over build decisions
- Users gain practical choice
- "Fork it" becomes irrelevant (no fork needed)

### Medium Term (3-5 years)

**Community creates:**
- Hundreds of opinions for popular packages
- Consensus opinions emerge
- Multiple builders verify reproducibility
- Pre-built opinions available

**Impact:**
- Expert opinions compete with each other
- Users choose based on needs, not authority
- Diversity of opinion normalized

### Long Term (5+ years)

**Ecosystem shifts:**
- Other distros adopt opinion systems
- Upstream projects consider build variants
- One-size-fits-all rejected
- User sovereignty normalized

**Impact:**
- The gatekeeper model is obsolete
- User choice is default
- Power is redistributed

## The Bottom Line

### What This Is

**A power transfer.**

From those who currently control package builds (DD, maintainers, experts) to those who actually use the software (common users).

### What This Isn't

- Not about technical superiority
- Not about disrespecting expertise
- Not about chaos or fragmentation

**It's about sovereignty.**

### The Core Belief

**Users are smart enough to make their own decisions.**

If systemd developers think systemd is best - great, that's their opinion.
If Debian thinks their build flags are optimal - great, that's their opinion.
If kernel maintainers think 250Hz is right - great, that's their opinion.

**But users should be empowered to hold different opinions without friction.**

### The Lebowski Thesis

**The free software movement took power from corporations and gave it to developers.**

**Lebowski takes power from developers and gives it to users.**

**This completes the revolution.**

## Call to Action

### For Users

**You don't need permission to:**
- Build packages your way
- Choose different opinions
- Verify builds yourself
- Reject gatekeepers

**Lebowski gives you the tools. Use them.**

### For Contributors

**You don't need to be a DD to:**
- Create opinions
- Maintain variants
- Share build configs
- Influence the ecosystem

**Contribute opinions. Build the community.**

### For the Movement

**Reject the new elite.**

They replaced corporate control with developer control.
We replace developer control with user sovereignty.

**Power to the people.**

Not the people who write the code.
Not the people who maintain the packages.

**The people who use the software.**

---

*"Yeah, well, that's just like, your opinion, man."*

**Exactly. And users deserve the power to hold their own opinions without gatekeepers standing in the way.**
