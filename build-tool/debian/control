Description: Reproducible Debian package builder with opinions
 Lebowski enables cryptographically verifiable package builds using
 opinions (YAML configs) and containers. Anyone can rebuild and verify
 identical binaries.
 .
 Features:
  - Bit-for-bit reproducible builds
  - Opinion-based build modifications
  - Container isolation for consistency
  - Build manifests with full provenance
  - GPG package signing support
  - XSC (zero-syscall) toolchain integration
 .
 Lebowski is designed for building custom Linux distributions,
 security auditing, and supply chain verification.
